*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative and culturally safe functional analysis of Ngarra's depression. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how his low mood, grief, and negative cognitions (especially about his identity and future) lead to profound behavioural withdrawal, which is stripping his life of connection and meaning, and reinforcing his hopelessness. **A non-negotiable first step is a compassionate risk assessment.**

**Theoretical Model: The Cognitive-Behavioural Model of Depression (Beck), adapted for Cultural Context**

```
*Note: Ngarra's downward spiral is profoundly driven by a loss of connection—to friends, community, and potentially Country. His withdrawal is not just from activities, but from his sources of identity and strength. This deepens his negative beliefs about his worth and future, which are tied to unresolved grief and conflict about his father.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 0: Immediate Risk Assessment & Establishing Safety (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Address the suicidal ideation directly, calmly, and compassionately. This MUST be the first step.
*   **Script:** *"Ngarra, thank you for coming in today. I know it took a lot to get here. Your friend Adrian mentioned he was worried about you, and that you'd been searching online about suicide. Can you tell me a little bit about that? When you have these thoughts, are you having thoughts of ending your life right now? Do you have a plan? ... Thank you for being so honest with me. My number one priority is to keep you safe while we work through this."*

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem in terms of his profound withdrawal.
*   **Script:** *"Okay, let's look at what this depression looks like day-to-day. It sounds like right now, it's taking over completely. You're spending **most of your time in bed**, you've **stopped going to work**, and you're **not responding to calls from friends**. It seems like you've become completely isolated. Is that how it feels?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers & Modifiers) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Explore the recent and historical triggers, paying close attention to relational and cultural factors.
*   **Script (Recent Triggers):** *"Your friend mentioned this got much worse after you were worrying about your cousin. It sounds like family and community are incredibly important to you, and when someone is in trouble, it hits you hard. Can you tell me about that?"*
*   **Script (Historical Context):** *"You also spoke about the complicated feelings you have about your father—idolizing him, but also feeling angry and frustrated about what happened. It sounds like a deep, unresolved hurt. How much does the thought, 'Am I going to turn out like him?' play on your mind?"*
*   **Script (Cultural Context):** *"You mentioned feeling homesick. What does that mean for you? What are you missing about being at home? Is it family, connection to community, connection to Country?"*

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Downward Spiral) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Link his withdrawal to the loss of connection and reinforcement of his core negative beliefs.
*   **Script (The Hot Thought):** *"When you're lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, what's the main thought that's running through your head about yourself?"* (Guiding for: "I'm worthless," "I'm a failure," "There's no point").
*   **Script (Consequences of Behaviour):** *"By staying in bed and not going to work or seeing friends, what happens to your connection with the things that used to make you feel good or capable? Your work, where you're highly skilled and have won awards? Your mates? Your community?"*
*   **Script (Closing the Loop):** *"Right. So the depression makes you withdraw, the withdrawal cuts you off from everything that gives you strength and identity, and that feeling of being cut off then seems to 'prove' the depression's thought that you're 'worthless'. It's a powerful, lonely trap."*

**Stage 4 & 5: Strengths & Formulation Summary (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Highlight his skills, past resilience, and the strength of his connections, and summarise the formulation.
*   **Script:** *"Ngarra, this sounds incredibly painful. But what I'm also hearing is that you are a highly skilled and capable mechanic. You have deep connections to your mum and your cousins. And you have a mate like Adrian who cares enough to bring you here. These are your strengths, and our way out of this trap will be to find small ways to reconnect you to them."*
*   *"So, the map looks like this: Deep feelings of hurt, homesickness, and worry have triggered this depression. The depression tells you you're worthless and makes you withdraw. The withdrawal cuts you off from your strengths—your work, your friends, your community—which makes you feel even more worthless. Our first step will be to work from the outside-in, to find one small action to break that cycle of isolation. How does that sit with you?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the cognitive-behavioural model of depression in a culturally safe and relevant way, using an analogy of connection and disconnection.

**Key Principles (from W13 lecture notes):** Acknowledge cultural context (holistic health, importance of community/kinship).

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Introduce a Culturally-Relevant Analogy (The "Tree and its Roots")**
*   *"Ngarra, one way to think about this depression is like a strong tree. A tree gets its life and its strength from its roots, which are connected to the earth, to water, and to all the other trees around it. For people, especially for Aboriginal people, those roots are our connections—to our family, our mates, our community, our skills, and our Country."*

**Step 2: Explain the Downward Spiral using the Analogy**
*   **The "Sickness" (Depression):** *"It sounds like a sickness has come into the tree. This sickness, the depression, starts to tell the tree lies. It tells it, 'You're weak, you're rotten, you're no good.' It makes the tree feel heavy and tired."*
*   **"Pulling up the Roots" (Behavioural Withdrawal):** *"Because the tree feels sick and believes these lies, it starts to pull its own roots out of the ground. It stops drawing strength from the earth. For you, this has been pulling away from work, where you're skilled; pulling away from your mates who support you; and feeling disconnected from home and community."*
*   **The Vicious Cycle:** *"The problem is, the more the tree pulls up its roots, the weaker and sicker it actually becomes. This then 'proves' the lie that it was 'rotten' all along. This is the downward spiral you're caught in: the depression makes you disconnect, and the disconnection makes the depression stronger."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (The "Outside-In" Approach)**
*   **Rationale for Behavioural Activation (BA):** *"So, our first job isn't to argue with the 'sickness'. Our first job is to work from the **outside-in** to help the tree put just one or two small roots back into the ground. We need to find one small, achievable action that reconnects you to a source of strength, even for a moment."*
*   **Action Before Motivation:** *"We're not going to wait until you *feel* strong enough. The principle of **Behavioural Activation** is that the action must come first, and the feeling of strength and motivation will follow, even if only a little at first. Our first step is to find one small root to put back in the earth."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for Behavioural Activation, with specific, culturally safe adaptations for Ngarra.

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Behavioural Activation (BA) with Cultural Adaptation**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The primary, first-line behavioural technique for Ngarra's depression is **Behavioural Activation**. The core rationale is to break the vicious cycle of withdrawal and isolation by systematically re-engaging him in activities that provide a sense of **connection, pleasure, or mastery**. For Ngarra, the focus must be on activities that align with his values, particularly those related to community, family, and demonstrating his skills."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed, Culturally-Adapted Procedure**
*   **1. Activity Monitoring:** *"First, we would start with gentle activity monitoring. I wouldn't ask him to fill out a complex hourly chart, as that might be overwhelming. Instead, I might say, 'For the next few days, can you just notice what you're doing? We can talk about it when we next meet.' This is a less confronting start."*
*   **2. Identifying Values and Goals (Collaborative & Yarning Style):** *"The most crucial step is identifying activities that are meaningful *to him*. I would use a collaborative, yarning approach. I'd ask questions like: 'When you were feeling good, what did you enjoy doing?', 'What does being a good mate or cousin look like to you?', 'You're a skilled mechanic. What's one small thing you could tinker with for 10 minutes?'."*
*   **3. Activity Scheduling (Starting Small & Focusing on Connection):** *"We would schedule one or two highly achievable activities. Success is paramount in the first week. For Ngarra, a good first step would *not* be 'go for a run,' but something relational:"*
    *   *e.g., "Your mate Adrian is worried about you. What if your one job for this week is to send him one text message saying 'Thanks for looking out for me'?"*
    *   *e.g., "What about spending 10 minutes looking at some photos from back home, just to reconnect with that feeling?"*
*   **4. Monitoring:** *"Instead of formal P and M ratings, I might ask, 'After you sent that text, what did you notice? Was there even a 1% shift in how you were feeling?' This is a softer, more relational way of tracking."*

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Ngarra in evaluating a core depressive belief, while maintaining cultural safety.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "I'm worthless, like crap. My family will be better off without me." (Conviction: 95%).

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Validate First, Explore Second:** *"Ngarra, that is a heavy, painful thought. Thank you for trusting me with it. It sounds like the depression is telling you a very convincing but very cruel story about yourself. Would it be okay if we just looked at that story together for a minute?"*
2.  **Gather Evidence Against (Focus on Actions & Relationships):** *"Let's look at the evidence against this 'worthless' story. You're a skilled mechanic with awards. You have a mate who cares enough to bring you here. You have a mum and cousins who you are deeply connected to. What do these relationships and skills say about your worth?"*
3.  **Use the Double Standard / Community Technique:** *"If you saw one of your cousins going through a hard time like this, and they told you they felt 'worthless', what would you say to them? Would you agree with them? Or would you remind them of their strengths and their importance to the family?"*
4.  **Explore the 'Better Off Without Me' Idea:** *"When the depression tells you your family will be 'better off without you,' what does it ignore? What would be lost for your mum, your cousins, your mate Adrian, if you weren't here? Let's talk about the space you hold in their lives."*
5.  **Develop a More Balanced / Compassionate Thought:** *"So, given that you are skilled, that you are loved, and that you would fight for your cousin if he felt this way, what is a kinder, more true story to tell yourself when the depression hits?"* (Guide towards: "The depression makes me *feel* worthless, but the evidence of my skills and my relationships shows that I have value. My struggle is not my identity.").

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Distraction & Refocusing**

*   **Rationale:** *"Given the severity of Ngarra's symptoms and his deep rumination, a purely cognitive approach might be too much initially. A supportive, first-step cognitive technique would be **Distraction and Refocusing**. The rationale is not to suppress the thoughts, but to gently unhook from the ruminative spiral and shift attention to the present moment, providing immediate, short-term relief and reducing the intensity of the negative mood."*
*   **Procedure:** *"I would collaboratively brainstorm appropriate distractors with Ngarra. This could be simple physical tasks, like exercise, or sensory grounding. For Ngarra, a culturally appropriate refocusing exercise could be to step outside, take his shoes off, and simply focus on the feeling of the earth under his feet for five minutes, noticing the temperature, the texture, and his connection to that place. This grounds him in the present moment and can be a powerful way to reconnect to Country, even when he is away from home."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, culturally safe, and highly achievable Behavioural Activation homework task.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly (Focus on one small connection)**
*   **Task:** *"Ngarra, our main goal this week is just to put one small root back in the ground to fight this isolation. Your entire homework for the week, your one job, is to **send one text message to your mate Adrian**. The message can be as simple as, 'Hey mate, thanks for bringing me to that appointment.' That's it."*
*   **Monitoring:** *"There's no chart to fill out. When we meet next week, we can just have a yarn about how it felt to do that one small thing."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The reason for this one small task is that right now, depression has you in a cycle of total disconnection. This text message is a single, powerful act of connection. It's not about feeling better instantly. It's about taking one small step in the opposite direction of the depression. It's an experiment to see that you are still capable of action, even when you feel completely drained. This one act breaks the rule that the depression has set, which says you have to stay isolated."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What might get in the way of sending that text? What's the hardest part about it?"* (He might say, "I don't know what to say," or "I don't have the energy").
*   **Plan B / Scaffolding:** *"Okay, what if we make it even easier? What if we write the text together right now, and all you have to do is press 'send' sometime before we meet next? Or, if that's still too much, what if you just open your phone and read the last message Adrian sent you? The goal is a single, small act of moving *towards* connection instead of away from it. What feels like a possible first step for you?"*
*   **Re-check Risk:** *"Finally, Ngarra, because things are so tough right now, I need to make sure you have support. I'm going to give you the number for the Brother-to-Brother crisis line, which is a 24/7 support line for Aboriginal men. Can we agree that if you have strong thoughts of harming yourself, you will call them or the number I'm giving you for the local mental health team?"*
