### **Page 1 of 5: CB Assessment (Roleplay Component)**
*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Jason's GAD. The goal is to move beyond listing his many worries and build a shared formulation that explains the *process* of worry itself—how his intolerance of uncertainty and his beliefs about worry (meta-cognitions) are the true engine of the disorder.

**Theoretical Model: The Metacognitive Model of GAD (Wells, 2005)**

*Note: This model shows that a trigger leads to initial "What if?" worries (Type 1). These are maintained by **Positive Meta-Beliefs** (e.g., "Worrying helps"). However, the worry process itself becomes distressing, activating **Negative Meta-Beliefs** (e.g., "I can't control my worry"). This creates "worry about worry" (meta-worry), which is the core of GAD and leads to unhelpful coping strategies.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem not as the content of the worries, but as the *process* of worrying itself.
*   **Script:** *"Jason, thank you for coming in. Your GP mentioned you've been struggling with a lot of anxiety. I've read about your worries—about your mother's health, your job, your relationship. It sounds exhausting. From a CBT perspective, the problem isn't necessarily the topics you worry about—everyone worries about those things sometimes. The problem we need to tackle is the **worry process itself**—the fact that once a worry starts, it feels uncontrollable, it keeps you up at night, and it's draining your energy. Is that where you feel the real struggle is?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers for a Worry Chain) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Identify the types of events that trigger a prolonged worry episode.
*   **Script:** *"Let's take a recent example. When was the last time you got caught in one of those worry spirals? ... Okay, when your girlfriend mentioned a family dinner. What was the *first* 'what if' thought that popped into your head?"*
*   **Probing for Uncertainty as a Trigger:** *"It seems like the triggers are often situations where the outcome is uncertain or not 100% guaranteed. How comfortable are you, in general, with 'not knowing' how things will turn out?"* (This directly probes **Intolerance of Uncertainty**).

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Metacognitive Cycle) (~4 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the positive and negative beliefs about worry (meta-cognitions).
*   **Script (Probing Positive Meta-Beliefs):** *"That's a really interesting question. On some level, do you feel like worrying is helpful? For example, does worrying about your mother's health feel like you're being a good, responsible son? Does worrying about a work project help you prepare for all possibilities?"* (This identifies the beliefs that kick-start the worry).
*   **Script (Probing Negative Meta-Beliefs - CRITICAL STEP):** *"Okay, so the worry starts because it feels helpful. But what happens when you've been worrying for an hour? How do you feel then? What do you start to think *about the worry itself*?"* (Guide for: "I can't stop this," "This anxiety is going to make me sick," "I'm going crazy with worry." This is **meta-worry**).
*   **Script (Probing Unhelpful Coping):** *"When you're stuck in that state of meta-worry, what do you do to try and get rid of the feeling? Do you try to distract yourself, seek reassurance from your girlfriend, or maybe just try to push the thoughts out of your mind?"*

**Stage 4: Identify Strengths & Cultural Context (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Acknowledge his achievements and the cultural pressures he feels.
*   **Script:** *"Jason, I want to acknowledge the immense pressure you're under. You're trying to balance your parents' very high expectations, which come from a place of love and wanting the best for you, with your own life and relationship. Despite this, you have a good job and you're building a life for yourself. Your desire to be a good son and partner is a huge strength, even if the worry it creates has become unhelpful."*

**Stage 5: Integrate into a Preliminary Formulation (Collaborative Summary) (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Verbally summarise the Metacognitive model, making it specific to Jason.
*   **Script:** *"So, it seems we have a two-stage process. A **Trigger** (like an uncertain situation) starts a 'what if' **Worry**. Initially, this feels helpful or responsible (a **Positive Belief**). But the worry process quickly becomes exhausting and feels uncontrollable, which triggers a second wave of worry—'worry about worry' (a **Negative Belief**). This is the real engine of GAD. To cope, you use strategies that unfortunately don't solve the problem and just keep you stuck. Our goal will be to target those beliefs *about* worry to help you step out of the cycle. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the Metacognitive Model of GAD, normalizing worry but differentiating helpful problem-solving from unhelpful worry spirals.

**Key Principles (from W4 lecture notes):** Normalise; use analogies; differentiate concepts; link to treatment.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Normalise Worry and Differentiate**
*   *"Jason, the first thing to know is that having worries is not the problem. Worry is a normal human emotion. It's like a mental problem-solver. If you have a real, controllable problem—like an upcoming bill—worry is helpful. It prompts you to make a plan and pay the bill. Problem solved."*
*   *"But GAD is different. It's when the problem-solver gets stuck on problems that are either **uncontrollable, hypothetical, or far in the future**—like your mother's health or the future of your relationship. It's like a car spinning its wheels in the mud. There's a lot of noise and smoke, but you're not actually going anywhere. This unhelpful wheel-spinning is what we need to address."*

**Step 2: Introduce Meta-Cognitions (The "Thinking about Thinking" Trap)**
*   **The "Worry is Good" Belief:** *"The reason the wheels start spinning is often because of a belief that worrying is useful. You mentioned your parents expected you to uphold the family's status. It's possible you've developed a belief that 'A responsible person worries' or 'If I worry, I can prevent bad things'. This belief is the 'gas pedal' for the worry."*
*   **The "Worry is Bad" Belief:** *"But after spinning for a while, you start to worry about the worry itself. You think, 'I'm losing control of my thoughts,' or 'This anxiety is damaging my health.' This is called **meta-worry**, and it's like throwing fuel on the fire. It's the core of the GAD trap."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan**
*   **Rationale for Cognitive Restructuring:** *"So, our treatment won't be about getting rid of your worries. It will be about changing your *relationship* with them. We will use **Cognitive Restructuring** to specifically examine and challenge those 'meta-beliefs'—both the idea that worry is helpful and the idea that it's uncontrollable and dangerous."*
*   **Rationale for Behavioural Experiments:** *"We'll also use **Behavioural Experiments**. For example, we'll run tests to see what actually happens if you *postpone* your worrying, to challenge the belief that it's uncontrollable. We'll give you back control of the 'worry machine'."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for a primary behavioural technique for GAD that targets the meta-belief of uncontrollability.

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Worry Postponement / "Worry Time"**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"A key behavioural technique for Jason is **Worry Postponement**, also known as scheduling 'Worry Time'. The rationale is to directly challenge his negative meta-belief that his worry is uncontrollable. By successfully and repeatedly postponing his worries to a designated time, he gathers direct, experiential evidence that he *does* have control over the timing and engagement with the worry process."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed Procedure**
*   **1. Scheduling 'Worry Time':** *"First, we would collaboratively schedule a specific, 30-minute 'Worry Time' for the same time and place each day (e.g., 7:00 PM at the kitchen table). This is the *only* time he is 'allowed' to engage in his unhelpful worry spirals."*
*   **2. The Postponement Process:** *"Throughout the day, whenever a 'what if' worry pops into his head, his instruction is to acknowledge it but not engage with it. He is to write it down on a 'worry list' and tell himself, 'That's a good worry, I'll deal with that tonight at 7:00 PM'."*
*   **3. Engaging in Worry Time:** *"During the scheduled Worry Time, he is to take out his list and worry about those items as intensely as he can for the full 30 minutes. He must stay there for the whole time, even if the worries lose their power."*
*   **4. The Outcome:** *"What clients like Jason almost always discover is twofold: first, they find they *can* postpone the worry, which breaks the belief of uncontrollability. Second, when they come back to the worry list at 7:00 PM, many of the worries have lost their emotional charge or seem irrelevant, demonstrating that they are not as urgent as they feel in the moment."*

**Step 3: Link to the Overall Treatment**
*   *"This technique is not a long-term solution in itself, but a powerful initial experiment. It breaks the illusion of uncontrollability and provides a clear demonstration of the difference between a thought and an urgent command, paving the way for deeper cognitive work on his other meta-beliefs."*

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Jason in evaluating a core GAD meta-belief. To be prepared to name and describe an alternative.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue targeting a Meta-Belief**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "I can't control my worry; once it starts, it just takes over." (Negative Meta-Belief).

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Thought & Validate:** *"Jason, let's put that specific belief under the microscope: 'I can't control my worry.' It must feel incredibly powerless to believe that. Can we explore that idea for a few minutes?"*
2.  **Gather Evidence For:** *"What's your evidence for this belief? What happens that makes it feel so completely uncontrollable?"* (He will describe the experience of worry chains).
3.  **Gather Evidence Against (Search for Exceptions):** *"That sounds very powerful. Let me ask you this: has there ever been a time when a worry started, but you got distracted by something important—a phone call from work, for example—and the worry had to stop, at least for a little while? What does that experience tell us about its 'uncontrollability'?"*
4.  **Use an Analogy:** *"If you had a song stuck in your head, would you say you have *zero* control over it? You can't just 'will' it to stop, but you could choose to put on different music, or focus on a conversation, which would eventually push it out. Could worry be like that—not 100% controllable, but something you can influence?"*
5.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"So, given that you have been able to interrupt it at times, even briefly, what might be a more accurate way to describe your relationship with worry? Is it '100% uncontrollable,' or something else?"* (Guide towards: "Worry feels uncontrollable and is very difficult to stop, but I do have some ability to shift my focus away from it, even if it's just for a short time.").
6.  **Re-rate Conviction:** *"How does that new perspective feel? How believable is it on a 0-100 scale?"*

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Pie Chart targeting a Positive Meta-Belief**

*   **Rationale:** *"An alternative cognitive technique would be to target one of Jason's **Positive Meta-Beliefs**, such as 'Worrying about my mother's health is my responsibility and helps keep her safe.' We could use the **Responsibility Pie Chart** to challenge this."*
*   **Procedure:** *"I would draw a circle representing 100% of the responsibility for his mother's health. I'd then ask him to list all the *other* factors that contribute to her health (e.g., her own choices, her doctor, her diet, genetics, public health measures). We would then assign percentages to each of these factors. Inevitably, Jason's slice of the pie for 'worry' would be very small, maybe 1-2%. This provides a powerful visual disconfirmation of his belief that his worry is a primary protective factor, and we can then discuss more effective ways to show he is a caring son."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant homework task based on the principle of Worry Postponement.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Jason, your homework this week is to conduct the **Worry Postponement** experiment we discussed. I'd like you to schedule a 30-minute **'Worry Time' for every day at 7:00 PM**. Throughout the day, when a worry comes to mind, your task is to jot it down on a notepad and postpone engaging with it until your scheduled time. During Worry Time, you must sit with your list and worry about the items for the full 30 minutes."*
*   **Monitoring:** *"Please bring your 'worry lists' to our next session. We will review them together."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is twofold. First and foremost, it is a direct experiment to test your meta-belief that worry is uncontrollable. Every time you successfully postpone a worry, you are gathering powerful evidence that you have more influence over your mind than you currently believe. Second, it will help you differentiate between the urgent *feeling* of a worry and its actual importance. You may discover that by the time you get to your Worry Time, many of the day's worries have lost their power. This is a foundational step in learning to step back from your thoughts and choose where you put your focus."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What do you predict will be the hardest part of this experiment for you? What might get in the way?"* (He might say, "I'll forget and just start worrying anyway").
*   **Plan B:** *"That's a very common challenge. Let's set up a 'Plan B'. What if we start smaller? For the first three days, let's not worry about the whole day. Let's just try to postpone any worries that arise between 9 AM and 12 PM. We can use reminder alarms on your phone. This way, we are practicing the skill in a shorter, more manageable window. The goal is to practice the muscle of disengagement, not to be perfect from day one. How confident do you feel about trying this?"*
