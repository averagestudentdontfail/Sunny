### **Page 1 of 5: CB Assessment (Roleplay Component)**
*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Olga's OCD. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how she misinterprets normal intrusive thoughts as highly significant and dangerous, leading to intense anxiety and compulsive rituals designed to neutralize the perceived threat.

**Theoretical Model: The Cognitive Model of OCD (Salkovskis, 1985)**

*Note: This model shows that the problem in OCD is not the intrusive thought itself (which everyone has), but the catastrophic **misinterpretation** of it. Olga appraises her thoughts about contamination as meaning she is in grave danger and has a profound responsibility to prevent it. This appraisal causes intense anxiety, which she tries to manage with **compulsions** (rituals). The temporary relief she gets from the ritual powerfully reinforces the compulsion and strengthens the original belief that the thought was dangerous and the ritual was necessary.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem by clearly separating the obsessions (internal events) from the compulsions (external behaviours).
*   **Script:** *"Olga, thank you for coming in with Tom. It sounds like these fears about contamination have become incredibly distressing and are causing a lot of conflict. Let's map this out. From what you're saying, there seem to be two parts to this. First, there are the intrusive, scary **thoughts or images** about getting contaminated with HIV. Second, there are the things you **do** to try and feel safe, like the **excessive washing and showering**, **avoiding public places**, and urging your family to follow your rituals. Does that sound like the right way to separate it?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Identify the specific external cues that trigger the intrusive thoughts.
*   **Script:** *"Let's talk about the triggers. What kind of things 'set off' these contamination fears? You mentioned seeing stains on the road or dirty public seats. What else? A news report? Seeing someone who looks unwell?"*

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The OCD Maintenance Cycle) (~4 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the core misinterpretation (inflated responsibility) and the function of the compulsions.
*   **Script (The Hot Thought/Obsession):** *"Okay, so you see a stain on a public bus seat. What is the *exact thought* or image that immediately pops into your mind?"* (Guiding for: "That could be blood," "I could get HIV from that," "I could pass it to Tom and Nigel").
*   **Script (Probing the Misinterpretation - CRITICAL STEP):** *"That's a scary thought. The key question is, what does having that thought *mean* to you? Does it feel like just a random thought, or does it feel like a serious warning that you are in real danger and that you have a responsibility to act?"* (This probes **Inflated Responsibility**).
*   **Script (Linking Anxiety to Compulsion):** *"When you have that thought and you feel that sense of responsibility, how high does your anxiety get on a 0-100 scale? ... And what do you feel an overwhelming *urge* to do in that moment to get rid of that anxiety?"* (Guiding for: "I *have* to wash," "I *have* to decontaminate").
*   **Script (Consequences of the Compulsion - Negative Reinforcement):** *"And after you perform the washing ritual, what happens to your anxiety in the short term? ... It goes down. That relief feels good. But what does it teach your brain for the next time? Does it teach it that the stain was actually safe, or does it teach it that the *washing* is what saved you from a terrible danger?"* (This explicitly highlights the negative reinforcement that strengthens the obsession-compulsion link).

**Stage 4 & 5: Strengths & Formulation Summary (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Acknowledge her insight and motivation, and summarise the model.
*   **Script:** *"Olga, I want to acknowledge something very important. You mentioned that on one level, you understand these fears are excessive. That insight is a huge strength. Your motivation to get help for the sake of your family is another. You are not your thoughts; you are someone who is being tormented by an OCD cycle."*
*   *"So, the model looks like this: A **Trigger** leads to an **Intrusive Thought**. The problem isn't the thought, but the fact that your OCD gives it a **Catastrophic Meaning** about danger and responsibility. This creates intense **Anxiety**, which you try to neutralize with a **Compulsion**. The ritual provides temporary relief, but it powerfully reinforces the entire cycle. We call this the OCD trap. The good news is, there is a gold-standard, highly effective treatment to break this cycle. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the cognitive model of OCD, normalizing intrusive thoughts and clearly differentiating them from the compulsions that maintain the disorder.

**Key Principles:** Normalize intrusive thoughts; use a clear analogy; link directly to treatment.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Normalize Intrusive Thoughts**
*   *"Olga, the first and most important thing to understand about OCD is that the problem is **not your thoughts**. Everyone on the planet has bizarre, unwanted, intrusive thoughts. Our brains are thought-generating machines, and sometimes they produce junk. If I told you 'Don't think about a pink elephant,' you'd immediately think of one. The difference for people without OCD is that they dismiss these junk thoughts as meaningless. They might think, 'Wow, that was a weird thought,' and move on."*

**Step 2: Explain the OCD Trap (The "Sticky Mind" Analogy)**
*   *"For people with OCD, it's like your brain has 'mental Velcro' or is extra 'sticky' for certain types of thoughts. When a junk thought about contamination comes along, it gets stuck. Your OCD then misinterprets the thought. It tells you:"*
    *   ***Thought-Action Fusion:*** *"'Thinking this is as bad as it happening' or 'This thought means I secretly want it to happen'."*
    *   ***Inflated Responsibility:*** *"'This thought is a warning, and now I am 100% responsible for making sure nothing bad happens to me or my family'."*

**Step 3: Explain the Role of Compulsions**
*   *"This sense of danger and responsibility creates unbearable anxiety. To get rid of it, your brain tells you that you *must* perform a ritualâ€”the compulsion. The washing makes you feel better for a little while. But here's the trap: the relief you feel powerfully teaches your brain two lies: 1) 'The original thought must have been very dangerous,' and 2) 'The only thing that saved me was the ritual.' So, the next time the thought appears, the urge to do the ritual is even stronger."*

**Step 4: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (ERP)**
*   **The Rationale for Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP):** *"So, the only way to break this cycle and un-stick the thoughts is with a treatment called **Exposure and Response Prevention**, or ERP. It has two parts. The **'Exposure'** part means we will gradually and safely face the things you fear, like touching a public doorknob. The **'Response Prevention'** part, which is the most important, is that we will work together to help you resist the urge to perform the compulsion. By doing this, you allow your anxiety to come down naturally, and your brain gets a chance to learn a powerful new lesson: 'The thought was just a junk thought, the situation was not actually dangerous, and I didn't need the ritual to be safe'."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for the gold-standard behavioural technique for OCD: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The undisputed gold-standard behavioural treatment for Olga's OCD is **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**. The rationale is to break the negatively reinforcing link between obsessions and compulsions. The **Exposure** component involves systematically confronting feared stimuli (objects, thoughts, situations) to elicit obsessive distress. The crucial **Response Prevention** component involves blocking the compulsive rituals that are used to reduce this distress. This process allows for **habituation** to the anxiety and, more importantly, provides powerful **extinction learning** that the feared catastrophe does not occur, and that the rituals are not necessary for safety."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed Procedure**
*   **1. Hierarchy Construction:** *"First, we would collaboratively create a graduated 'fear ladder' or hierarchy of feared contamination situations. The list would contain 10-15 specific tasks, ordered by her SUDS rating from 0-100. This empowers Olga and ensures we start at a manageable level."*
*   **2. In-Session ERP:** *"We would begin with a moderately difficult task in-session, for example, 'Touching the outside of a public rubbish bin with a tissue and then touching her handbag with the same tissue'."*
*   **3. The Exposure:** *"She would perform the exposure task."*
*   **4. **CRITICAL: The Response Prevention:** *"The core of the therapy then begins. For a prolonged period (e.g., 60-90 minutes), she would be instructed to **prevent all rituals**. For Olga, this would mean no hand washing, no changing clothes, and no seeking reassurance from me about whether she is safe. She must 'sit with' the anxiety and the urge to ritualize."*
*   **5. Habituation and Learning:** *"Her anxiety will naturally peak and then begin to subside on its own. This process demonstrates habituation and teaches her that the urge to ritualize is like a wave that she can surf, rather than a command she must obey."*
*   **6. Homework:** *"The exact same ERP task is then assigned for daily homework to consolidate the learning."*

**Step 3: Provide a Sample Hierarchy for Olga**

| Step | Exposure Task | Response Prevention | Predicted SUDS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Watch a TV show about hospitals for 10 minutes. | No ritualistic washing afterwards. | 40 |
| 2 | Sit on a public transport seat for 5 minutes. | Do not wipe down seat; do not change clothes immediately upon arriving home. | 55 |
| 3 | Touch a public doorknob without using a tissue. | Do not wash hands for at least 1 hour. | 70 |
| 4 | Step on a stain on the footpath deliberately. | Do not clean shoes or avoid wearing them in the house. | 85 |
| 5 | Touch the rim of a toilet bowl in a public restroom with a gloved finger, then touch her phone with the glove. | Do not wash phone or hands for 1 hour. | 100 |

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Olga in evaluating a core OCD belief (misinterpretation). To be prepared to name and describe an alternative.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "If I have a thought about getting HIV, it means I am in real danger and I am 100% responsible for preventing it." (Inflated Responsibility).

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Belief & Validate:** *"Olga, let's look at that belief: 'This thought means I'm in danger, and I'm responsible.' That sounds like an immense weight to carry. It's completely understandable that you'd feel the need to do everything you can to protect your family if you believe that. Can we examine the belief itself?"*
2.  **Differentiate Thought from Reality:** *"Let's think about thoughts. Have you ever had a random, silly thought, like 'I could just start singing loudly right now'? Did you do it? What's the difference between *having a thought* about something and that thing being true or something you have to act on?"*
3.  **Use the Pie Chart Technique (as Socratic Method):** *"Let's talk about responsibility. If someone were to contract an illness, let's draw a pie chart of all the things that would be responsible for that. What would be on the list?"* (Guide her: "The person's own immune system," "Public health standards," "Doctors," "Pure chance/bad luck"). *"Now, where would we put 'Olga saw a stain and had a thought about it'? How big of a slice of the pie does that deserve?"*
4.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"Given that everyone has intrusive thoughts and that there are hundreds of factors contributing to health, what is a more realistic way to view your role when you have a thought about contamination?"* (Guide towards: "This is just an OCD thought. It's not a real warning. My actual responsibility is to live a normal, healthy life, not to react to every thought my brain produces.").

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Behavioural Experiment**

*   **Rationale:** *"A powerful cognitive technique for OCD is a **Behavioural Experiment** designed to directly challenge a core belief. For Olga, this would challenge the idea that her thoughts or minor contact have catastrophic power."*
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Belief:** "If I step on a 'contaminated' stain, I will contract HIV." (Conviction: 90%).
    *   **Experiment (Observational):** *"The experiment would be for us to go to a busy public area. We would identify a stain on the footpath. Our task would be to simply stand there for 15 minutes and count how many people step on or over that stain without a second thought."*
    *   **Learning:** *"The purpose is to gather data that challenges her perception of threat and highlights base rates. We would then discuss: 'We saw 50 people step on that stain. According to NSW Health statistics, what is the likelihood that all 50 of them will now contract HIV? What does this tell us about the actual level of danger versus what your OCD is telling you?'"*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant ERP homework task.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Olga, your homework for this week is to practice the first ERP task from our hierarchy. The task is: **Once a day, you will deliberately watch a 10-minute segment of a TV medical drama, like 'Grey's Anatomy'.**"*
*   **The Response Prevention:** *"The most important part of the homework is the **response prevention**. After watching, you are to **resist the urge to do any ritualistic washing or showering related to the show for at least one hour.** You are to just sit with the anxiety and any intrusive thoughts that come up."*
*   **Monitoring:** *"Please use this ERP diary to record your SUDS before you start the show, the peak level during or after, and what it is at the end of the one-hour period. And note down what you learned."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is to begin retraining your brain. By exposing yourself to a trigger (the hospital show) and then **blocking the compulsive response** (the washing), you are breaking the OCD cycle at its most critical point. You are giving your brain the opportunity to learn a new, vital piece of information: 'I can have anxious thoughts and feelings, and if I do nothing, the anxiety will come down on its own, and nothing catastrophic will happen.' This is how we take the power away from the OCD."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What do you predict will be the hardest part of this homework? What is the biggest fear about not washing?"*
*   **Plan B:** *"If watching for 10 minutes feels impossible, what's a 50% version of that? Could you watch for 5 minutes? Or watch a less intense show? ... Okay, Plan B is to start with 5 minutes. And if the urge to wash feels overwhelming, your job is to just try and delay it by 5 more minutes. Any delay is a victory. The goal is to practice resisting, not to be perfect. How confident do you feel about giving this a try?"*
