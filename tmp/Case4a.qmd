*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Debra's depression. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how her negative cognitions and low mood lead to behavioural withdrawal and inactivity, which in turn strips her life of pleasure and mastery, reinforcing her depressive beliefs and creating a downward spiral.

**Theoretical Model: The Cognitive-Behavioural Model of Depression (Beck)**

```
*Note: This model shows that a trigger activates Debra's negative beliefs (the cognitive triad: negative view of self, world, and future). This worsens her mood and physical symptoms (like fatigue), leading her to withdraw from her life (**Behavioural Inactivity**). This withdrawal means she no longer gets positive reinforcement from activities that used to provide pleasure (like seeing friends) or a sense of mastery (like exercising). This lack of positive experience seems to provide powerful evidence that her negative beliefs are true, which worsens her mood and fuels the cycle.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem in concrete, behavioural terms, focusing on the changes in her activity levels.
*   **Script:** *"Debra, thank you for coming in. It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, what you've described as a 'big black hole'. Let's try to map out what that looks like day-to-day. You've mentioned your sleep and eating are disturbed, and you feel hopeless and weak. In terms of your behaviour, what have you **stopped doing** over the last two months? You mentioned you've **stopped exercising** and are **avoiding friends and family**. Are there other activities that have dropped off?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers & Modifiers) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Investigate the events that precipitated the episode and the thoughts that trigger low mood now.
*   **Script (Precipitating Events):** *"You mentioned this episode began a couple of months after your partner cheated on you and you separated. While you felt you were coping okay at first, it sounds like that was a major life event just before this 'black hole' appeared. Does that timing seem right to you?"*
*   **Script (Proximal Triggers):** *"Now, think about yesterday. What was happening or what were you thinking about right before you had a dip in your mood or felt that sense of emptiness?"* (Probing for current triggers).

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Downward Spiral) (~4 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the cognitive triad and link it to the behavioural withdrawal and subsequent loss of reinforcement.
*   **Script (Eliciting the Hot Thought/Cognitive Triad):** *"When you wake up in the morning and feel that lack of energy, what's the first thought that goes through your mind? What does that feeling say about *you*? About your *day*? About your *future*?"* (This probes the **Cognitive Triad** of self, world, future).
*   **Script (Linking Mood to Behaviour):** *"So you feel hopeless and tired, and that makes you avoid your friends and stay home. That makes perfect sense. When you're feeling that way, the motivation just isn't there."*
*   **Script (Consequences of Behaviour - Loss of Reinforcement):** *"Here's the key question. Before this episode, when you would exercise or see your friends, how did that make you feel? ... Right, a sense of accomplishment, connection, pleasure. Now that those activities are gone, where are you getting those feelings from? ... It sounds like the withdrawal, while it feels necessary, has stripped your life of the very things that used to recharge your battery and make you feel good."*
*   **Script (Closing the Loop):** *"And when your life feels empty of pleasure and accomplishment, what does that do to those initial thoughts, like 'I'm hopeless' or 'things are empty'? Does it make them feel more true, or less true?"* (This explicitly highlights how the behaviour *confirms* the cognitions).

**Stage 4: Identify Strengths & Resources (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Validate her past coping and highlight her existing support network.
*   **Script:** *"Debra, even though you feel weak right now, you have a history of being incredibly resilient. You've overcome two previous episodes of depression. You're a well-regarded teacher, and you have good social support from friends and family who have helped you before. These are strengths we can absolutely draw on again."*

**Stage 5: Integrate into a Preliminary Formulation (Collaborative Summary) (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Verbally summarise the downward spiral model.
*   **Script:** *"So, it seems we have a 'downward spiral'. A **Trigger** like the break-up activated some **Negative Beliefs**. This led to a **Low Mood and Fatigue**. To cope, you started to **Withdraw** from your life, which makes total sense. But this withdrawal has **drained your life of pleasure and mastery**, which then seems to **prove that the negative beliefs are true**, which in turn makes your mood even lower. It's a vicious cycle, but the good news is we can break it by intervening directly on the behaviour. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the cognitive-behavioural model of depression, focusing on the "downward spiral" and the rationale for using behavioural intervention first.

**Key Principles (from W4 lecture notes):** Use an "outside-in" rationale; use a clear analogy.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Introduce the Model & Analogy (The "Depression Battery")**
*   *"Debra, I want to share a model for how depression works and how it maintains itself. Think of your mood and energy like a rechargeable battery. Activities like exercising, seeing friends, or accomplishing tasks at work are your 'chargers'. They fill your battery up."*
*   *"When a major life event happens, like your break-up, and your mood drops, it's like your battery is already low. Depression then tells you the smartest thing to do is to 'conserve energy'. It tells you to stop doing things, to stay home, to unplug from all your chargers."*

**Step 2: Explain the Downward Spiral**
*   **The Vicious Cycle:** *"Here's the cruel trick of depression. By unplugging from all your 'chargers' (friends, exercise), your battery level drops even lower. This makes you feel more tired, more hopeless, and less capable. This low energy state then 'proves' to you that the initial depressive thought ('I'm incapable') was correct. So, the less you do, the worse you feel, and the worse you feel, the less you do. This is the 'downward spiral' of depression."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (The "Outside-In" Approach)**
*   **The Rationale for Behavioural Activation (BA):** *"Because of this, trying to 'think' your way out of depression is like trying to start a car with a dead battery. It often doesn't work. The most effective strategy is to work from the **outside-in**. We need to manually plug you back into some of your 'chargers', even if you don't feel like it and even if they only give you a 1% charge to start."*
*   **Action Before Motivation:** *"This approach is called **Behavioural Activation**. The core principle is that **motivation follows action, not the other way around**. We're not going to wait for you to *feel* like exercising. We are going to schedule the exercise, treat it like an experiment, and see what it does to your mood and energy. By gradually re-introducing activities that provide pleasure or mastery, we will start recharging your battery, which will give you the energy and cognitive space to then work on the unhelpful thought patterns."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for the primary behavioural technique for Depression: Behavioural Activation (BA).

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Behavioural Activation (BA)**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The primary, first-line behavioural technique for Debra's depression is **Behavioural Activation**. The core rationale is to break the vicious cycle of withdrawal and avoidance that is maintaining her low mood. By systematically increasing her engagement in reinforcing activities, we aim to increase her contact with sources of pleasure and mastery. This provides opportunities for positive reinforcement, which directly counters the feelings of hopelessness and anhedonia, and provides powerful, real-world evidence against her negative self-beliefs."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed Procedure**
*   **1. Activity Monitoring:** *"The first step is for Debra to become a 'scientist' of her own life. For one week, she would use an **Activity Monitoring Log** to track her daily activities on an hourly basis and rate her mood (0-10) for each activity. The purpose is to establish a baseline and identify any small links between her activities and her mood."*
*   **2. Identifying Values and Goals:** *"We would then collaboratively explore her values. What's truly important to her? Being a good friend? Being healthy? We use these values to guide our choice of activities."*
*   **3. Activity Scheduling:** *"Next, we would collaboratively schedule specific, concrete activities into her week. The key is to start small and schedule for success. We would schedule activities that provide a sense of **Pleasure** (e.g., listening to music) and/or **Mastery** (e.g., doing one load of laundry). For Debra, recommencing exercise and scheduling a short coffee with a friend would be excellent starting points."*
*   **4. Monitoring Pleasure & Mastery:** *"After each scheduled activity, she would rate the amount of Pleasure and Mastery she experienced (0-10). This is crucial, as her depressed mind might discount any positive experience. The written rating provides objective data."*
*   **5. Review and Problem-Solve:** *"In the following session, we would review the activity log together, troubleshoot barriers (like low motivation or hopelessness), and use her successes to build momentum for scheduling more complex activities."*

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Debra in evaluating a core depressive belief, noting this would occur *after* some success with BA. To be prepared to name and describe an alternative.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "I am incapable and weak. I'll never get back to my old self." (Conviction: 90%)

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Thought & Validate:** *"Debra, thank you for sharing that thought from your diary. 'I am incapable and weak.' That's a heavy one, and it makes complete sense you'd feel hopeless if that's what your mind is telling you. Can we place that belief under the microscope?"*
2.  **Gather Evidence Against (linking to BA):** *"Let's look at the evidence. This week, you scheduled and completed a 20-minute walk, even when you didn't feel like it. What does that action say about the 'incapable and weak' idea? What does an 'incapable' person do in that situation?"*
3.  **Examine Definitions:** *"Let's define our terms. What is your definition of a 'weak' person? Does it mean someone who struggles, or someone who gives up completely? Based on your actions this week, which category do you fall into?"*
4.  **Use the Double Standard Technique:** *"If your best friend came to you, having gone through a painful break-up and feeling depressed, and she told you 'I'm so weak because I can't just snap out of it,' what would you say to her?"*
5.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"So, given that you are taking steps to get better, and that you would have compassion for a friend in your shoes, what's a more accurate and compassionate way to think about yourself right now?"* (Guide towards: "I am feeling depressed and everything feels hard, but I am taking small, brave steps to get better. Struggling does not mean I am weak.").
6.  **Re-rate Conviction:** *"How much do you believe that new thought, 0-100%?"*

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Continuum Work**

*   **Rationale:** *"An excellent cognitive technique to challenge Debra's 'all-or-nothing' thinking (e.g., 'I'm a complete failure') is **Continuum Work**. It is a visual technique that helps clients move away from black-and-white judgments and see themselves and their situations in a more nuanced, realistic way."*
*   **Procedure:** *"I would draw a line on a piece of paper, from 0% to 100%. I would label 0% as '0% Incapable' and 100% as '100% Completely Incapable'. I'd ask Debra to define what a '100% incapable' person would look like (e.g., 'Can't get out of bed, can't feed themselves'). Then I'd ask her to define a '0% incapable' person (e.g., 'Perfect, never makes mistakes'). We would then place her on that line based on the evidence of her week. This visually demonstrates that while she may not be at 0%, she is certainly not at 100%, breaking the all-or-nothing cognitive distortion."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant Behavioural Activation homework task.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Debra, our focus this week is to continue working from the outside-in to start recharging your battery. Your homework is to continue with the **Activity Monitoring Log** and to schedule in **three specific activities** from the list we brainstormed."*
*   **Specifics:** *"These will be: 1) A 20-minute walk on Tuesday and Thursday morning (a **Mastery** activity), and 2) Calling your sister Shirley for a 15-minute chat on Saturday (a **Pleasure** activity)."*
*   **Monitoring:** *"After each activity, I need you to immediately rate the level of **Pleasure (P)** and **Mastery (M)** you experienced, from 0 to 10, right on the log."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is to directly fight back against the depression. The depression is maintained by inactivity and withdrawal; this homework is a direct counter-attack. We are not waiting for motivation. We are scheduling the action first to *create* motivation. By tracking Pleasure and Mastery, we are gathering objective data that will prove to you that even when your mood is low, you are still capable of creating positive experiences for yourself. This is the most crucial first step in reversing the downward spiral."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What do you predict will be the hardest part of this? What might get in the way of, for example, that walk on Tuesday?"* (She might say, "I'll feel too tired," or "I'll think, what's the point?").
*   **Plan B:** *"Let's plan for that. If you wake up Tuesday and your 'depression voice' is telling you not to go, the experiment is to try anyway. But if a 20-minute walk feels impossible, what is a Plan B that is still a step forward? A 5-minute walk? Just putting on your walking shoes and stepping outside? Perfect. The goal is a small victory, not a marathon. Any step forward is a win against the depression. How confident do you feel you can try this?"*
