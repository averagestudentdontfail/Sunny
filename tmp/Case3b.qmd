### **Page 1 of 5: CB Assessment (Roleplay Component)**
*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Carlos's specific phobia. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how a combination of past vulnerability (childhood cupboard incident) and a recent critical incident (friend being robbed in a lift) has led to a conditioned fear response to enclosed spaces, which is now maintained by avoidance.

**Theoretical Model: Mowrer's Two-Factor Model of Phobia Development**

*Note: This model shows that Carlos's phobia was acquired through **Classical Conditioning**, where neutral stimuli (lifts, helmets) became associated with intense fear. The phobia is now **maintained by Operant Conditioning**; every time he avoids the feared stimulus, his anxiety decreases, which provides a powerful sense of relief. This relief **negatively reinforces** the avoidance behaviour, strengthening the phobia and preventing him from learning that the situations are safe.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem in concrete terms, focusing on the specific feared stimuli and the resulting avoidance behaviours.
*   **Script:** *"Carlos, thank you for coming in. It sounds like this fear of enclosed spaces is really starting to get in the way of your work and life. Let's get a clear picture. The main problem seems to be an intense fear when you're in **lifts, small toilets, and even when wearing your helmet for too long**. This fear leads you to **avoid these situations** whenever possible, or to do things like **pulling over for breaks** while riding. Is that a good summary of what's been happening?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers & Learning History) (~3 mins)**
*   **Action:** Investigate the specific triggers and trace the learning history of the phobia.
*   **Script (Current Triggers):** *"When you have to take a lift for a delivery, what is it about the lift that triggers the fear? Is it the doors closing? The movement? The feeling of being trapped? Is it worse when it's crowded?"*
*   **Script (Probing Learning History):** *"You mentioned two key events in your past. First, being locked in a cupboard as a child, where you felt anxious and had trouble breathing. Second, your friend being robbed at knifepoint in a lift a year ago. It seems like the fear of suffocation from childhood got powerfully reignited and linked to lifts after hearing about that robbery. Does that connection make sense to you?"* (This validates and explains the phobia's development).

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Maintenance Cycle) (~3 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the core catastrophic thoughts and the reinforcing nature of avoidance.
*   **Script (Eliciting the Hot Thought):** *"Okay, so you're in a crowded lift. The doors close. What is the *exact thought* that goes through your mind? What is the absolute worst thing you're afraid will happen?"* (Guiding for: "I'll pass out," "I won't be able to breathe," "I'll be trapped and something bad will happen").
*   **Script (Linking Thought to Physical Sensations):** *"And when you have that thought, 'I'm going to pass out,' what happens in your body? You mentioned feeling breathless, dizzy, and sweaty. Do these feelings get stronger after the thought?"*
*   **Script (Consequences of Avoidance - Negative Reinforcement):** *"So, instead of taking the lift, you take the stairs, even if it makes you late. What happens to your anxiety when you make that choice to avoid the lift? ... It goes down, right? That feeling of relief is very powerful, but what it accidentally teaches your brain is, 'Taking the stairs saved me from danger.' This is what keeps the fear of lifts alive."*

**Stage 4: Identify Strengths & Resources (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Highlight his motivation and resilience.
*   **Script:** *"Carlos, despite this fear and a difficult childhood, you've moved to a new country, you're working two jobs, and you have clear goals to become an electrician or plumber. You're also motivated enough to seek treatment after seeing a TV show. This tells me you are resilient, resourceful, and ready to make a change."*

**Stage 5: Integrate into a Preliminary Formulation (Collaborative Summary) (~1 min)**
*   **Action:** Verbally summarise the two-factor model, making it specific to Carlos.
*   **Script:** *"So, it looks like we have a clear two-part story. Part one is how the fear started: a childhood fear of being trapped and suffocating got strongly attached to lifts after the scary incident with your friend. Part two is what keeps the fear going now: **avoidance**. Every time you avoid a lift or a helmet, you get immediate relief, which strengthens the phobia. It's a classic fear cycle, and the best part is, because we understand it so well, we have a very clear, evidence-based plan to break it. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the conditioning model of specific phobias and the rationale for exposure therapy, using a simple, powerful analogy.

**Key Principles (from W4 lecture notes):** Normalise the fear response; use a clear analogy; link directly to treatment.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Normalise the Fear Response (The "False Alarm" Analogy)**
*   *"Carlos, your brain has developed a very powerful 'false alarm' system. Think of it like a smoke alarm that has been programmed to go off not just for fire, but for anything that even looks like smoke. After your friend's traumatic experience, your brain learned to treat lifts as a 'fire'—a truly dangerous situation. Now, it's over-learning, and it's starting to treat anything that feels similar—like a tight helmet or a small room—as the same kind of danger."*

**Step 2: Explain the Role of Avoidance (The Maintenance Factor)**
*   *"The problem is what we do when an alarm goes off. If you run out of the building every time the smoke alarm beeps, you never stick around long enough to see if it was a real fire or just steam from the kettle. **Avoidance is the fuel that keeps a phobia alive.** Every time you take the stairs instead of the lift, you're telling your brain, 'You were right to set off the alarm. That lift was dangerous.' This reinforces the false alarm and makes it even more sensitive for next time."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (Exposure Therapy)**
*   **The Rationale for Exposure:** *"So, to fix this, we need to re-program your brain's alarm system. The only way to do that is to gradually and safely approach the things you've been avoiding. We need you to stay in the building long enough to see that it was just 'steam' and not a 'fire'. This process is called **Exposure Therapy**. It's the single most effective treatment for phobias."*
*   **How it Works (Habituation):** *"We will do this in a step-by-step way. We'll start with something that's only a little bit scary and have you stay with it until your brain's alarm naturally quiets down. This process is called **habituation**. Like getting into a cold pool, it's uncomfortable at first, but your body gets used to it. By doing this repeatedly, you provide new, powerful learning to your brain that these situations are not, in fact, dangerous."*

**Step 4: Address the Specific Fear of Passing Out**
*   *"You mentioned a fear of passing out. We can also address that directly. I can explain the 'fight-or-flight' response, which actually *increases* blood pressure and makes fainting *less* likely. This knowledge can give you extra confidence as we begin the exposure work."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for the primary behavioural technique for Specific Phobia: Graded In-Vivo Exposure.

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Graded In-Vivo Exposure**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The gold-standard and primary behavioural technique for Carlos's specific phobia is **Graded In-Vivo Exposure**. The rationale is to break the cycle of avoidance and fear through direct, systematic confrontation with the feared stimuli. The goal is to facilitate **habituation**, where his anxiety response naturally decreases with prolonged contact, and **extinction learning**, where the conditioned link between lifts/helmets and fear is broken."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed Procedure**
*   **1. Hierarchy Construction:** *"First, we would collaboratively create a graduated 'fear ladder' or hierarchy. This would contain 10-15 specific, concrete, real-world tasks involving enclosed spaces, ordered by his SUDS rating from 0-100. This gives Carlos a sense of control and ensures the process is manageable."*
*   **2. In-Session Exposure:** *"We would begin in-session with a task that is challenging but achievable, likely rated around 40-50 SUDS on his hierarchy. For example, 'Watching a first-person video of a lift ride for 5 minutes'."*
*   **3. Prolonged & Repeated Exposure:** *"The instruction is to remain 'exposed' to the stimulus until his SUDS rating peaks and then drops by approximately 50%. This demonstrates habituation. We would repeat the task multiple times if necessary."*
*   **4. **CRITICAL: Eliminating Safety Behaviours:** *"Before each exposure, we would identify and agree to eliminate any safety behaviours. For Carlos, this would mean not pulling over while riding with his helmet on, or not distracting himself on his phone while in a lift. These behaviours must be dropped for new learning to occur."*
*   **5. Assigning Homework:** *"Once he has mastered a step in-session, the same task is assigned as daily homework. Repetition is key to consolidating the new learning."*

**Step 3: Provide a Sample Hierarchy for Carlos**

| Step | Task | Predicted SUDS (0-100) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Wear his motorcycle helmet indoors for 5 minutes straight. | 30 |
| 2 | Watch a 5-minute point-of-view video of a crowded lift ride. | 40 |
| 3 | Stand in a small, single-person toilet with the door closed for 1 minute. | 50 |
| 4 | Wear his helmet while riding for 15 minutes without stopping. | 60 |
| 5 | Stand with me in an open lift while the doors open and close 3 times. | 70 |
| 6 | Ride the lift with me up one floor and down one floor. | 80 |
| 7 | Ride the lift alone for one floor. | 90 |
| 8 | Ride a crowded lift for 3 floors during a busy time of day. | 100 |

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Carlos in evaluating a catastrophic thought related to his phobia. To be prepared to name and describe an alternative.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "If I feel breathless in a crowded lift, I will pass out." (Conviction: 85%)

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Thought & Validate:** *"Carlos, that's a very specific and frightening thought: 'If I feel breathless, I will pass out.' It makes complete sense why you'd avoid lifts if you believe that. Can we look at that belief like a scientist for a few minutes?"*
2.  **Gather Evidence For & Against:** *"What's your evidence that breathlessness leads to passing out? Has it ever happened before? ... Okay, so it hasn't happened. Now, what's the evidence against it? Think about times you've been breathless from running or playing sports. Did you pass out then?"*
3.  **Provide Alternative Explanations (Psychoeducation):** *"Let's look at the biology here. The feeling of breathlessness in anxiety is from 'fight-or-flight.' This response actually *increases* your blood pressure to get your muscles ready for action. Fainting is caused by a sudden *drop* in blood pressure. So, biologically, the anxiety response makes you *less* likely to faint, not more. How does hearing that fit with your belief?"*
4.  **Use the Double Standard Technique:** *"If you saw a friend who was nervous about public speaking, and they told you they felt breathless, would you tell them 'You're probably going to pass out'? Or would you say something else?"*
5.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"So, given that it's never actually happened, that you've been breathless many times without fainting, and that the biology shows it's unlikely, what's a more realistic thought to have when you feel breathless in a lift?"* (Guide towards: "This feeling of breathlessness is just anxiety. It's uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous and it doesn't mean I'm going to pass out. The feeling will pass.").
6.  **Re-rate Conviction:** *"How believable is that new thought right now, from 0-100%?"*

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Behavioural Experiment**

*   **Rationale:** *"While exposure is the main behavioural intervention, we can frame one as a cognitive technique to directly test his belief about passing out. A **Behavioural Experiment** would provide powerful, experiential data to challenge this catastrophic prediction."*
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Belief:** "If I become breathless for more than 2 minutes, I will pass out." (As noted in your summary).
    *   **Experiment:** *"The experiment would be to induce breathlessness in a controlled way, right here in the office. We could have him run on the spot for two and a half minutes. His task is to see if the predicted outcome (passing out) actually occurs."*
    *   **Learning:** *"The purpose is to gather irrefutable evidence. Afterwards, we would debrief: 'You were breathless for over two minutes. What actually happened? What does this result tell you about the connection between breathlessness and fainting?'. This directly disconfirms his belief and builds his confidence to enter feared situations."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant homework task based on the first step of the Graded Exposure hierarchy.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Carlos, your homework for this week is to start climbing your 'fear ladder.' Based on the hierarchy we built, your task is Step 1: **You are to wear your motorcycle helmet while sitting in your living room for 5 minutes straight, once every day.**"*
*   **Monitoring:** *"Please use this **Situational Exposure Diary**. Each day, I want you to record your SUDS rating before you put the helmet on, the highest point it reaches during the 5 minutes, and what it is when you take it off. Most importantly, write down what you learned or discovered from the experience."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is to begin the process of retraining your brain. Each time you complete this task and nothing bad happens, you are providing new, powerful evidence that contradicts the 'false alarm'. You are teaching your brain through direct experience that the feeling of constriction is safe. This is the first, essential step to breaking the entire fear cycle. The real change and progress in overcoming a phobia happens through this consistent, repeated practice between our sessions."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What do you think might get in the way of you doing this every day? What will be the most difficult part?"*
*   **Plan B:** *"If 5 minutes feels too long to start, what would feel challenging but doable? 3 minutes? ... Perfect. Plan B is to start with 3 minutes and build up to 5 over the week. The goal is to get started and build momentum. How confident are you, 0-100%, that you can try this homework?"*
*   **Dropping Safety Behaviours:** *"And when you're doing this, it's very important to not use any 'tricks' to get through it, like listening to music or watching TV to distract yourself. We want your brain to be fully present to learn that the situation is safe on its own. Can we agree to that?"*
