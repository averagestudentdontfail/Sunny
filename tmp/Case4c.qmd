### **Page 1 of 5: CB Assessment (Roleplay Component)**
*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Daniel's depression. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how his retirement (loss of role/purpose) and health concerns have activated core negative beliefs, leading to profound behavioural withdrawal (inactivity, isolation). This withdrawal strips his life of pleasure and mastery, reinforcing his hopelessness and creating a powerful downward spiral.

**Theoretical Model: The Cognitive-Behavioural Model of Depression (Beck), adapted for Retirement/Loss of Role**

```
*Note: Daniel's downward spiral is critically linked to the loss of his work role. Work provided structure, purpose, and a sense of mastery. Without it, a vacuum has been created, which is now filled by his negative beliefs about aging and usefulness. His inactivity directly confirms these beliefs, creating a potent, self-maintaining cycle.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem in terms of specific, observable behaviours.
*   **Script:** *"Daniel, thank you for coming in. It sounds like this past year since retirement has been incredibly difficult. Let's get a clear picture of what a typical day looks like for you right now. You've mentioned **spending most of the day in your pyjamas**, **finding it hard to get out of bed**, and mostly **watching television**. You've also stopped doing the **fun activities you used to share with Rosa** on weekends. Is that a fair description of the main changes?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers & Modifiers) (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Pinpoint the key life event that triggered the episode and the daily triggers for low mood.
*   **Script (Precipitating Event):** *"It seems very clear that this whole episode was kicked off by your retirement last year, when the charity branch closed. Before that, even though you were working long hours, you felt energetic and engaged. Does it feel like that's where the shift began?"*
*   **Script (Proximal Triggers):** *"On a day-to-day basis now, what triggers that feeling of sadness or emptiness? Is it waking up in the morning and seeing a day with nothing in it? Or is it seeing Rosa go off to work?"*
*   **Script (Probing Health Anxiety):** *"You also mentioned the recent hernia surgeries and your fears about dementia, like what happened with your father. How much does this worry about your health contribute to your feeling that 'things will go downhill'?"*

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Downward Spiral) (~4 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the core cognitions and link them to the behavioural withdrawal and subsequent loss of reinforcement.
*   **Script (Eliciting the Hot Thought):** *"When you're wandering around the house in your pyjamas, what is the core thought that's running through your mind? What does this situation say about you and your life now?"* (Guiding for: "My life has no purpose or meaning," "I'm useless now," "I'm just waiting to get old and sick").
*   **Script (Consequences of Inactivity):** *"That makes sense. So that thought and the low energy make you stay home and watch TV. Here's the key question: Before you retired, your work at the charity, where you went 'above and beyond', how did that make you feel? ... Right, a sense of purpose, of being valued, of accomplishment. Where are you getting those feelings from now?"*
*   **Script (Closing the Loop):** *"Exactly. It sounds like the very things that used to provide you with a sense of mastery and purpose are now gone. And this empty feeling then seems to provide powerful proof that your original thought, 'My life has no purpose,' is 100% true. It's a vicious cycle."*

**Stage 4 & 5: Strengths & Formulation Summary (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Validate his past contributions and strengths, and summarise the model.
*   **Script:** *"Daniel, what's also incredibly clear is that for over 20 years as an engineer and then for six years at the charity, you were a highly competent, dedicated, and valued person. You have a history of being energetic and hard-working. You also have a strong, 30-year marriage with Rosa. These are not things that just disappear. The skills and the character are still there; the depression is just hiding them right now."*
*   *"So, the map looks like this: **Retirement** took away a huge source of your purpose and structure. This activated some powerful **Negative Beliefs** about being useless. This **Low Mood** makes you **Withdraw** from life, which strips away any remaining pleasure or mastery, which in turn **Confirms** the negative beliefs. Our first job is to break the behavioural part of that cycle. We need to find a way to add a small bit of structure and purpose back into your day. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the cognitive-behavioural model of depression, using an analogy that speaks to the experience of retirement and loss of purpose.

**Key Principles:** Use a relevant analogy; explain the "outside-in" approach; normalise the experience.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Introduce the Model & Analogy (The "Retired Engine")**
*   *"Daniel, one way to think about what's happened is like this: For your entire adult life, you've been a powerful, high-performance engine. As an engineer and then at the charity, you were running every day—you had fuel, you had a direction, and you were firing on all cylinders. You had a purpose."*
*   *"Retirement, for many people, is like someone suddenly switching that engine off. The engine is still perfectly good, all the parts are there, but it's sitting cold in the garage. After a while, a bit of rust can start to set in. The battery starts to go flat. This 'rust' is the depression. It's not that the engine is broken; it's that it's been inactive."*

**Step 2: Explain the Downward Spiral**
*   **The Vicious Cycle:** *"The problem is, the flatter the battery gets (your mood and energy), the harder it feels to start the engine. Your mind starts to tell you, 'See, the engine is old and useless now. It'll never run properly again.' So you don't even try to turn the key. The inactivity seems to prove the negative thoughts are true, and the battery drains even more."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (The "Outside-In" Approach)**
*   **Rationale for Behavioural Activation (BA):** *"Because of this, we can't wait until you *feel* like starting the engine. The motivation won't be there. We have to work from the **outside-in**. Our first job is to find the smallest possible way to turn the key and get the engine to idle, even for just five minutes. This is called **Behavioural Activation**."*
*   **Action Before Motivation:** *"The core idea is that **action precedes motivation**. We are going to collaboratively schedule one or two small, achievable 'engine starts' into your week. These won't be huge things, but small actions that give a tiny spark of purpose or pleasure. By doing this, we'll slowly start to clear the rust and recharge the battery. Once the engine is running a bit, it will be much easier to work on the 'unhelpful manual'—the negative thoughts."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for Behavioural Activation, with specific adaptations for Daniel's context.

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Behavioural Activation (BA)**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The primary, first-line behavioural technique for Daniel's depression is **Behavioural Activation**. The rationale is to directly counter the behavioural withdrawal that is maintaining his depression. By re-engaging him in activities that are aligned with his values and provide sources of pleasure, mastery, or social connection, we aim to increase his contact with positive reinforcement. This will directly improve his mood and energy, and provide powerful, experiential evidence to challenge his core beliefs about being 'useless' and having 'no purpose'."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed, Adapted Procedure**
*   **1. Activity Monitoring:** *"First, we would start with activity monitoring. I'd ask Daniel to use an **Activity Log** to simply record what he does each hour for a few days, and to rate his mood. This helps us get a baseline and see the strong link between his inactivity and his low mood."*
*   **2. Identifying Values and Past Reinforcers:** *"Next, we would explore what used to be important to him. What did he value about his work? (e.g., problem-solving, helping others, providing for family). What activities did he enjoy with Rosa? (e.g., weekend activities). This gives us a menu of potential 'value-driven' activities."*
*   **3. Activity Scheduling (Starting Small & Value-Driven):** *"We would then collaboratively schedule one or two highly achievable activities. For Daniel, these should ideally tap into his old sources of mastery and pleasure. For example:"*
    *   *Mastery: "Tackle one small, concrete 'engineering' task at home, like fixing a squeaky door or organizing the tools in the garage for 15 minutes."*
    *   *Pleasure/Connection: "Schedule a 20-minute walk with Rosa after she gets home from work, just to reconnect."*
*   **4. Monitoring Pleasure & Mastery:** *"After each scheduled activity, he would rate **Pleasure (P)** and **Mastery (M)** from 0-10. This is crucial for helping him recognize that he is still capable of creating these feelings for himself."*

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Daniel in evaluating a core depressive belief related to his age and retirement.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "My life has no purpose now that I'm retired. I'm just old and useless." (Conviction: 90%).

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Thought & Validate:** *"Daniel, that's a very painful thought to live with: 'My life has no purpose, I'm useless.' After a lifetime of hard work, it's understandable why the sudden stop of retirement would bring up that fear. Can we put that belief on the table and examine it?"*
2.  **Examine Definitions & Evidence:** *"Let's break that down. You're equating 'purpose' and 'usefulness' with your job. Is a person's value or purpose *only* defined by their paid employment? What about other roles you've had in life—as a husband, a friend, a colleague?"*
3.  **Use the Double Standard Technique:** *"Think about your own father. After he retired, before he got sick, did you consider him 'useless'? Or did you still see him as your father, a man with a lifetime of experience and stories?"*
4.  **Explore Alternative Sources of Purpose:** *"If being employed isn't the only way to have purpose, what are some other ways people find meaning in their lives after they retire?"* (Guide him: family, hobbies, volunteering, mentoring, learning new things).
5.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"So, given that your value is more than your job title, and that there are many ways to find purpose, what's a more accurate way to think about your situation?"* (Guide towards: "My role has changed since I retired, and I feel a loss of purpose right now. However, my worth as a person is not gone, and there are new ways I can find meaning and purpose in this next chapter of my life.").
6.  **Re-rate Conviction:** *"How does that new perspective feel? How believable is it on a 0-100 scale?"*

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Cost-Benefit Analysis**

*   **Rationale:** *"An alternative cognitive technique would be a **Cost-Benefit Analysis** of his core belief. This is useful for increasing motivation to change by helping the client see how unhelpful and 'costly' a particular belief is, even if it feels true."*
*   **Procedure:** *"I would draw two columns on a piece of paper: 'Advantages of believing I'm useless' and 'Disadvantages of believing I'm useless'. I'd ask Daniel to fill them out. The 'Advantages' column is usually short (e.g., 'It protects me from trying and failing'). The 'Disadvantages' column will be long (e.g., 'It makes me feel hopeless, it makes me withdraw from my wife, it gives me no energy, it stops me from enjoying anything'). Seeing this imbalance in black and white can powerfully motivate a client to start challenging the belief and trying new behaviours."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant Behavioural Activation homework task tailored to Daniel's situation.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Daniel, our mission this week is to start turning that engine back on. Your homework is to schedule **two specific 'engine start' activities** into your week."*
*   **Specifics:** *"Based on our discussion, these will be: 1) On Tuesday at 10 AM, you will spend **15 minutes in the garage organizing your toolbox**. 2) On Thursday evening, you and Rosa will go for a **20-minute walk together after she gets home from work.**"*
*   **Monitoring:** *"I'd like you to use this **Activity Log**. After each task, please rate the level of **Mastery** (for the toolbox) and **Pleasure/Connection** (for the walk) you felt, on a simple scale of 0 to 10."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is to directly fight the behavioural vacuum created by retirement. The toolbox task is designed to reconnect you with your identity as a capable, skilled engineer, providing a small dose of the 'mastery' feeling you've been missing. The walk with Rosa is designed to reconnect you with a source of pleasure and relational support. These are not just random tasks; they are targeted strikes against the depression, designed to prove to you, through your own actions, that you can still create feelings of purpose and enjoyment."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What's the biggest hurdle you see to getting that toolbox task done on Tuesday?"* (He might say, "I won't have the energy," or "It feels pointless").
*   **Plan B:** *"Let's plan for that. The 'depression voice' will definitely show up and tell you it's pointless. The experiment is to do it anyway. If 15 minutes feels like too much, what is a 5-minute version? Could you just take out the tools and wipe them down? Perfect. A 5-minute action is a 100% success for this week. The goal is to just turn the key. How confident are you that you can try this?"*
