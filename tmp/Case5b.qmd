Of course. Here is the complete, definitive, and Honours-level Exam Binder for Case 5b: Imogen (Illness Anxiety Disorder). This plan is fully detailed and focuses on the core features of the disorder: the catastrophic misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations, and the maintenance of anxiety through reassurance-seeking and safety behaviours like checking.

*(Essential Competency 1: Coverage of relevant issues & Assessment skills)*

**Objective:** To conduct a collaborative functional analysis of Imogen's Illness Anxiety. The goal is to build a shared formulation that explains how her pre-existing vulnerability (mother's traumatic death) leads her to catastrophically misinterpret benign bodily sensations as signs of severe illness (e.g., COVID), which is then maintained by a powerful cycle of checking, reassurance seeking, and avoidance.

```
*Note: This model shows that a trigger (often a normal sensation) is **misinterpreted** as a sign of serious illness. This causes anxiety, which leads to two key maintaining processes: 1) **Increased preoccupation and hypervigilance** towards the body, which makes her notice more 'symptoms', feeding back into the cycle. 2) A strong drive to perform **safety behaviours** like checking and reassurance seeking. The temporary relief from a negative test or a doctor's reassurance powerfully reinforces these behaviours, but fails to change the underlying belief, ensuring the cycle continues.*

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure (integrating the 5-Stage Model):**

**Stage 1: Identify the Problem Behaviours & Context (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Define the problem by clearly separating the anxiety/thoughts from the specific checking and reassurance-seeking behaviours.
*   **Script:** *"Imogen, thank you for coming in. It sounds like this worry about your health has become all-consuming. Let's get a clear picture of what's happening. I'm hearing about an intense **fear of having a serious illness**, currently COVID. This fear seems to lead to a lot of specific behaviours, like **repeatedly checking your temperature and throat**, doing **multiple COVID tests**, and **scaling down your work** to avoid exposure. Is that an accurate summary?"*

**Stage 2: Clarify Antecedents (Triggers & Learning History) (~3 mins)**
*   **Action:** Investigate the specific internal triggers (bodily sensations) and the powerful influence of her learning history.
*   **Script (Current Triggers):** *"Let's take a recent example. What was the very first thing you noticed that triggered the most recent cycle of worry and testing? Was it a tickle in your throat? A feeling of warmth? A news article about a new variant?"*
*   **Script (Probing Learning History):** *"You mentioned your mother's traumatic illness and death when you were 18. She was a 'health fanatic' and her cancer was completely unexpected. It's completely understandable that this would have taught you a powerful lesson, perhaps something like 'Health is fragile and unpredictable' or 'Even harmless symptoms can be a sign of something terrible'. How does that experience shape how you interpret your own body's signals today?"*

**Stage 3: Clarify Consequences (The Maintenance Cycle) (~3 mins)**
*   **Action:** Uncover the core misinterpretation and the reinforcing function of the safety/reassurance behaviours.
*   **Script (The Hot Thought/Misinterpretation):** *"Okay, so you feel a slight tickle in your throat. What is the *immediate, catastrophic thought* that goes through your mind?"* (Guiding for: "This is it, I have COVID," "It's going to be a severe case," "I won't be able to cope").
*   **Script (Linking Anxiety to Safety Behaviour):** *"When you have that terrifying thought, what do you feel an overwhelming *need* to do to be sure, to check, to feel safe?"* (Guiding for: "I *have* to take a test," "I *have* to check my temperature").
*   **Script (Consequences of the Behaviour - CRITICAL STEP):** *"And after you get a negative test result, what happens to your anxiety? ... It goes down, for a while. That relief is powerful. But what does that process teach your brain? Does it teach it 'My body is healthy and the throat tickle was nothing'? Or does it teach it, 'The *only* reason I feel safe right now is because of that negative test, and I'll need to test again as soon as I feel another symptom'?"* (This explicitly highlights how reassurance-seeking maintains the doubt and the cycle).

**Stage 4 & 5: Strengths & Formulation Summary (~2 mins)**
*   **Action:** Acknowledge her past periods of functioning well and summarise the model.
*   **Script:** *"Imogen, what's important to note is that you've had periods in your life, between ages 25-30, where these anxieties subsided. This tells us that you are not broken; you have the capacity to live without this constant fear. Your concern for your health, while currently in overdrive, comes from a place of wanting to live a full life."*
*   *"So, the map looks like this: A **Trigger**, like a normal body sensation, is **Catastrophically Misinterpreted** as a sign of severe illness, largely due to your past experiences. This creates intense **Anxiety**. To cope, you engage in **Safety Behaviours** like checking and testing. This provides temporary relief but strengthens the belief that you can't trust your own body and must rely on external checks for safety. Our goal is to break that cycle by reducing the checking and learning to tolerate the uncertainty. How does that sound?"*

### **Page 2 of 5: Psychoeducation (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To explain the cognitive-behavioural model of health anxiety, focusing on the concepts of hypervigilance and the "reassurance trap".

**Key Principles:** Normalize; use a clear analogy; differentiate helpful vs. unhelpful checking.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Introduce the Model & Analogy (The "Car Alarm")**
*   *"Imogen, a good way to think about illness anxiety is to imagine your body is a car, and your brain is the alarm system. After the trauma of what happened with your mum, your car alarm has become incredibly sensitive. It's now programmed to go off not just if someone breaks a window, but if a leaf falls on the roof or the wind blows too hard. It's constantly giving you false alarms."*

**Step 2: Explain the Key Components**
*   **Hypervigilance (Staring at the Car):** *"Because you're worried about the car, you start paying very close attention to it. You're constantly looking for dents and scratches. The problem with this is, the more you look, the more you find! You start noticing tiny things you never would have before, and each one becomes a potential sign of danger. This is **hypervigilance**—your attention is locked onto your body, so you notice every single ache, pain, and tickle, and each one becomes a new potential alarm."*
*   **The Reassurance Trap (Checking if the Car is Still There):** *"When an alarm goes off, you do what any sensible person would: you run to check on it. You take a COVID test or check your temperature. When the test is negative, you feel relief—the car is safe! But here is the trap: you credit the *checking* for your safety, not the fact that the car was never in danger in the first place. You learn that checking is the only way to feel safe, so you have to do it again and again, every time the alarm goes off. This is the **reassurance cycle**, and it's the engine of health anxiety."*

**Step 3: Link Directly to the Treatment Plan (ERP)**
*   **The Rationale for Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP):** *"So, our treatment plan is to recalibrate your car alarm. The only way to do that is with a method called **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**. It's a two-part process. The **'Exposure'** part means we will not be avoiding our bodies, but learning to sit with normal sensations. The **'Response Prevention'** part, which is the most important, is that we will work together to systematically and gradually **reduce and eliminate the checking and reassurance-seeking behaviours**. By not running to check the car every time a leaf falls, your brain will slowly learn, through direct experience, which alarms are real and which are false."*

### **Page 3 of 5: Behavioural Techniques (Viva-Voce Component)**

**Objective:** To name and provide a detailed rationale and procedural overview for the primary behavioural technique for Illness Anxiety Disorder: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).

**Primary Behavioural Technique:** **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: Name the Technique and Core Rationale**
*   *"The primary and most evidence-based behavioural technique for Imogen's Illness Anxiety Disorder is **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)**. The rationale is to break the powerful maintenance cycle of checking and reassurance-seeking. The **Exposure** component involves having her engage with her feared thoughts and sensations, while the **Response Prevention** component involves systematically blocking the compulsive safety behaviours. This allows her to learn that a) her catastrophic fears do not come true, and b) her anxiety will reduce on its own *without* the need for a safety behaviour. This builds tolerance for uncertainty and trust in her own body's signals."*

**Step 2: Explain the Detailed Procedure**
*   **1. Psychoeducation & Rationale:** *"First, I would ensure Imogen understands the 'reassurance trap' model and why reducing her checking behaviours, while anxiety-provoking in the short-term, is the only long-term solution."*
*   **2. Hierarchy Construction:** *"Next, we would collaboratively build a graduated hierarchy of her checking and reassurance-seeking behaviours, from the easiest to give up to the hardest. This gives her control over the process."*
*   **3. In-Session ERP:** *"We would start with a manageable item from the hierarchy. For example, 'If you feel a tickle in your throat, you must wait 30 minutes before checking your throat in the mirror'."*
*   **4. **CRITICAL: The Response Prevention:** *"The core of the therapy is the 'response prevention'. During that 30-minute delay, she must sit with the anxiety and the intense urge to check. Her job is to 'surf the urge' without giving in. We would practice this in session by inducing a sensation and having her delay the checking response right there with me."*
*   **5. Debrief and Learning:** *"After she successfully delays the check, we debrief. 'What happened? The urge was strong, but what did you learn about your ability to tolerate it? Did the feared outcome happen?' This consolidates the learning that she can handle the uncertainty."*

**Step 3: Provide a Sample ERP Hierarchy for Imogen**

| Step | Response Prevention Task | Predicted SUDS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Reduce checking temperature from 5x a day to 3x a day (morning, noon, night). | 40 |
| 2 | If you feel a throat tickle, wait 30 minutes before looking in the mirror. | 55 |
| 3 | Reduce temperature checks to once a day only. | 65 |
| 4 | Read a news article about COVID without doing a rapid test afterwards. | 75 |
| 5 | Stop checking temperature altogether. | 85 |
| 6 | When a symptom is felt, rely on your partner Mark for one check-in only, and accept his reassurance without doing your own test. | 90 |
| 7 | Go a full week without buying or using any rapid antigen tests. | 100 |

### **Page 4 of 5: Cognitive Techniques (Roleplay & Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 4: Cognitive techniques)*

**Objective:** To demonstrate Socratic Dialogue in a roleplay to guide Imogen in evaluating a core catastrophic belief. To be prepared to name and describe an alternative.

**Primary Technique (Roleplay): Socratic Dialogue**

**Target Belief for Roleplay:** "This feeling in my throat isn't just a tickle, it's a sign that I have severe COVID and it will be too severe to cope with." (Conviction: 99%).

**Step-by-Step Roleplay Procedure:**

1.  **Isolate the Thought & Validate:** *"Imogen, that's a terrifying thought: 'This isn't just a tickle, it's a sign of a severe case.' Given what you went through with your mum, it makes complete sense that your brain would jump to the worst-case scenario. Can we look at that thought more closely?"*
2.  **Examine the Evidence:** *"Let's look at the evidence. What evidence do you have that this specific tickle is a sign of *severe* COVID? ... On the other side, what's the evidence against this? How many times in the past month have you had a tickle or a sneeze that turned out to be nothing? How many negative tests have you had?"*
3.  **Introduce Alternative Explanations:** *"What are some other, more common, and non-catastrophic explanations for a tickle in the throat?"* (Guide her: allergies, dry air, a common cold, even just normal bodily noise). *"Out of 100 people with a tickle in their throat, how many do you think have severe COVID versus how many have something mundane?"* (This introduces base rates).
4.  **Use the Double Standard Technique:** *"If your partner Mark told you he had a tickle in his throat, what would be your first thought? Would you assume he had a severe case of COVID, or would you tell him it's probably nothing to worry about?"*
5.  **Develop a More Balanced Thought:** *"So, given that there are many more likely explanations, and that you wouldn't jump to this conclusion for Mark, what's a more realistic or helpful thought you could have when you feel that tickle?"* (Guide towards: "This is probably just a normal throat tickle. While there's a tiny chance it could be something, the overwhelming likelihood is that it's nothing serious. I can wait and see before I assume the worst.").

**Alternative Cognitive Technique (for Viva-Voce): Behavioural Experiment**

*   **Rationale:** *"A very powerful cognitive technique for Imogen would be a **Behavioural Experiment**, specifically an **observational survey**, to challenge her catastrophic predictions about the severity of COVID."*
*   **Procedure:**
    *   **Belief:** "If I get COVID, it will be too severe to cope with."
    *   **Prediction:** "Most people who get COVID experience severe, debilitating symptoms."
    *   **Experiment:** *"The experiment would be for us to create a very brief, anonymous survey. We could ask friends or colleagues: 'On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is 'on death's door', how would you rate the severity of your COVID symptoms when you had it?'. We would aim to collect 10-15 responses."*
    *   **Learning:** *"The purpose is to gather real-world data to challenge her 'all-or-nothing' prediction. We would then review the data together. She would likely find a wide range of experiences, with most falling in the mild-to-moderate range. This provides concrete evidence that her feared worst-case scenario is not the most likely outcome, which can reduce her anticipatory anxiety."*

### **Page 5 of 5: Learning Discovery / Homework (Viva-Voce Component)**
*(Essential Competency 5: Choice and explanation of homework task)*

**Objective:** To prescribe a clear, collaborative, and relevant ERP homework task.

**Step-by-Step Viva-Voce Script:**

**Step 1: State the Homework Task Clearly**
*   **Task:** *"Imogen, your homework for this week is to take the first step in disarming your 'car alarm'. We are going to begin the **Response Prevention** plan we designed. Your task is Step 1 from our hierarchy: **You will reduce your temperature checks from several times a day down to only three specific times: once after you wake up, once at midday, and once before bed.**"*
*   **The Response Prevention:** *"The most crucial part is this: **if you check at any other time, or if you feel a symptom at any other time, you must not check your temperature**. You will simply notice the urge, label it as 'health anxiety', and let it pass without acting on it."*
*   **Monitoring:** *"Please use this simple diary to log your three scheduled checks, and to make a note of any time you successfully resisted an unscheduled urge to check."*

**Step 2: Provide a Clear, Compelling Rationale**
*   *"The rationale for this homework is to begin breaking the cycle of reassurance. Every time you check your temperature and it's normal, your brain gets a short-term hit of relief, but it learns the lesson that checking is the only way to be safe. By resisting the urge to check, you are teaching your brain a new, more powerful lesson: 'I can feel anxious and uncertain, and if I do nothing, the feeling will pass, and I will still be okay.' This is how you build tolerance for uncertainty and start trusting your body again."*

**Step 3: Anticipate Barriers and Collaborate on a Plan B**
*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** *"What do you predict will be the hardest part of this? When will the urge to check be the strongest?"*
*   **Plan B:** *"Let's set a Plan B. If the urge to check feels completely overwhelming, before you reach for the thermometer, your task is to first try a 5-minute distraction. You can call Mark, listen to a song, or do a puzzle. The goal is to create a small 'buffer' between the urge and the action. Any delay you can create is a success because it proves the urge is not an emergency command. How confident do you feel about trying this?"*
